    "You explain your need to get further underground. \"Well, you could at least take the escalator down to the printing department, not that you'd get much further than that without the elevators working. That is, you could if the escalator weren't also offline.\"\n",

    "\"But, don't worry! It's not fried; it just needs power. Maybe you can get it running while I keep working on the elevators.\"\n",

    "The batteries are arranged into banks; each line of digits in your input corresponds to a single bank of batteries. Within each bank, you need to turn on exactly two batteries; the joltage that the bank produces is equal to the number formed by the digits on the batteries you've turned on. For example, if you have a bank like 12345 and you turn on batteries 2 and 4, the bank would produce 24 jolts. (You cannot rearrange batteries.)\n",

    "You'll need to find the largest possible joltage each bank can produce. In the above example:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>In 987654321111111, you can make the largest joltage possible, 98, by turning on the first two batteries.</li>\n",
    "    <li>In 811111111111119, you can make the largest joltage possible by turning on the batteries labeled 8 and 9, producing 89 jolts.</li>\n",
    "    <li>In 234234234234278, you can make 78 by turning on the last two batteries (marked 7 and 8)</li>\n",
    "    <li>In 818181911112111, the largest joltage you can produce is 92.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
